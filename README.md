# 2D Dungeon Adventurer Project
---
## Introduction
This is my first public project, which I decided to start with something more visual and interactive. The entire project will be in C++ and it is intended to be simple, for learning purposes.

## References
I'm using a few references to learn, which will also be uploaded in the README during the development.

## Gameplay
The main character is supposed to engage in combat with NPCs, be able to unlock skills, make choices and roam around the enviroment.

## Art Design
Since I'm not an artist, the design will purely consist of funny PNGs and/or GIFs.

## Soundtrack
Same goes here, only funny cat songs.

## Story Setup
You play as an evil cat, with malicious intent to pulverize the entire population of the dog world where they just woke up, in the beginning of their journey. Along your journey you will come across different NPCs, choices and unlockable skills.
