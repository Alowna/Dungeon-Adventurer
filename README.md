# 2D Dungeon Adventurer Project Progress
---
## Introduction
This is my first public project, which I decided to start with something more visual and interactive. There will be two repositories for such project, this one, intended to show the progress part by part, and the final project repository, where the actual complete game will be uploaded to.

## References
I'm using a few references to learn, which will also be uploaded in the README during the development.

## Gameplay
The main character is supposed to engage in combat with NPCs, be able to unlock skills, make choices and roam around the enviroment.

## Art Design
Since I'm not an artist, the design will purely consist of funny PNGs and/or GIFs.

## Soundtrack
Same goes here, only funny cat songs.
